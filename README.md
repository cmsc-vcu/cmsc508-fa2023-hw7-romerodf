This repository contains the files needed to build and display a resume database (Homework 7). 

This project consists of using DDL to build a resume database which captures the skills, employees, and roles within the company. The database will help find employees with specific skills and find any gaps in the skill sets of employees with certain roles.

The directory 'hw7' contains a hw7.qmd file which renders to the hw7.html file. The HTML displays key information on the database and as well as visualized tables to display data. The hw-7ddl.sql contains DDL code to create, drop and recreate tables within the database.
